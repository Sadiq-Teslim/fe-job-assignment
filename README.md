### ‚ú® Key Features & Approach

- **Mobile-First Responsive Design:** The application was styled for mobile devices first, with CSS media queries used to scale the layout up for tablet and desktop views, ensuring a seamless experience on any device.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** The UI was broken down into logical, reusable components (e.g., `ArticleCard`, `Sidebar`, `Header`) to create a maintainable and scalable structure.
- **High-Fidelity UI:** Meticulous attention was paid to matching the fonts, colors, spacing, and layout of the provided design references to create a pixel-perfect replica.
- **Static Data Hydration:** Since no backend was required, the application is populated via a typed, static `mockData.ts` file, cleanly separating the view layer from the data model.
- **Modern Development Practices:** The project uses transient props (`$`) in Styled Components to prevent invalid attributes from being passed to the DOM, ensuring a clean and warning-free console.
